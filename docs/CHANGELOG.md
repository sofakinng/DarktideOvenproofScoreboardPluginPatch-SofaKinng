v1.3.0

- Fix for Havoc crate pickups (thanks for noticing, Vatinas!)
    - Havoc modifier was being applied only to the ammo missing, not the actual pickup amount, so values were too low
        - e.g. Have 40% ammo and use crate with Havoc modifier of 85%
        - OLD: pickup was calculated as 60% * 85% = 51%
        - NEW: Pickup is 100% * 85% = 85%
    - Now calculates actual pickup amount and percentage
- Added more settings options
    - Grouped up ammo settings (messages and waste)
    - Added toggle to track ammo crate waste (defaulted to off to not have unexpected changes)
    - Added toggle to add ammo crate to total percentage of pickup
        - Added toggle to only do this in Havoc
        - Defaults to off to not have unexpected changes
- Refactored
    - Ammo pickup variables moved around to have less copied code (now that waste can be tracked for both)
    - Scoreboard mod check
        - Needs to check if Scoreboard is installed
        - Before, it was checking this... literally every single time something needed to be tracked...
        - Now I check it once on startup, when all mods load, and exit with an error message if it's not found
        - Also removed the checks for `if scoreboard then` because it's implied by having reached this far
    - Made mod version a global
        - Slightly worse performance on restart
        - Now other mods can check this mod's version, in case they rely on one of the features from a specific version onward
        - ...Nobody is going to do this
    - Moved hooks to only be executed after all mods are loaded, so they don't get executed if Scoreboard is not installed
- Logged uncategorized ammo pickup types, in case that's ever a thing
- Style
    - Moved helper functions above hooks
    - Indented breed tables and such, so my IDE can collapse them all at once
- Completely shit my pants when I saw `mod:manage_blank_rows()` was being called LITERALLY EVERY GAME TICK? BUTTER MY BUTT AND CALL ME A BISCUIT

# 2025-07-08
v1.2.5

- Localization fixes from Sai

# 2025-07-08
v1.2.4

- Added Brazilian Portuguese localization from Talesz

# 2025-07-08
v1.2.3

- Added fallback for havoc ammo modifier
    - Defaults to 1 if not found in table (low havocs don't use the values from that)
    - Added silent logging for this so I can debug later
- Made local variable for tostring for performance

# 2025-07-07
v1.2.2

- Readded the debug message suppression (how did that disappear???)
    - now also prints it silently into the log if they're suppressed
    - probably lost it when i used the versions with localizations from the nexus page
- Added `psyker_heavy_swings_shock` to ranged damage (tyvm syllogism :prayge:)
    - Put in ranged because it's electrocution on heavies from Smite sub talent and dog electrocution remote detonation (`adamant_whistle_electrocution` so I'm assuming that's what it is)
    - In `settings/buff/weapon_buff_templates.lua` they added the buff category to it, so before it was probably defaulting to melee/ranged (checked myself and thanks to syllogism for checking first)
    - `templates.adamant_whistle_electrocution.attack_type = attack_types.buff`

# 2025-07-01
v1.2.2-beta-fail

- Added check to separate shock maul electrocution and dog electrocution
    - Put `shockmaul_stun_interval_damage` into both `melee_damage_profiles` and `companion_damage_profiles`
    - Add to melee damage if it matches the damage profile AND attack type was NOT dog
    - No check needed for companion damage because it's an elseif
- nvm this was shit

# 2025-07-01
v1.2.1-beta

- Added localizations for new settings
    - I don't know who added these so I can't credit :(
    - Russian, Simplified Mandarin, and Traditional Mandarin
    - Originally these were from xsSplater, deluxghost, and SyuanTsai respectively (idk if they came back to do these new ones)

# 2025-06-27
v1.2.0-beta-branch

- Moved some units and damage types around
    - Mutator disablers (Grandfather's Gifts) from specialists to disablers. **Thanks Tunnfisk!**
    - Fix for bleed and warpfire damage counting as melee (removing buff from melee type. **thanks syllogism!**)
    - Moved `shockmaul_stun` to dog damage type, since shock maul electricity damage is less important than dog shocks (thanks for the suggestion syllogism!). Planning on a "cleaner" solution to this later
- Added ammo pickup modifiers from Havoc (pickups give less)
    - Check if mission is Havoc when starting a mission
    - If so, set the ammo modifier from the Havoc settings template
- Some code reorganizing to make it easier for me to read
- Coding style for the localizations
